# Quickstart: Claude Code Integration

This guide provides a quick overview of how to get started with the Claude Code integration within your development environment.

## 1. Requesting Assistance

To request intelligent assistance, use the provided interface within your development environment and submit your prompt or command. For example:

```
/assist "Fix the type errors in src/index.ts"
```

## 2. Authorizing Actions

If Claude Code proposes file modifications or command executions, you will be prompted for explicit authorization. Review the proposed changes carefully and approve or reject them as needed.

## 3. Conversational Context

Claude Code maintains conversational context within your current session. This means you can ask follow-up questions without repeating previous information. Note that this context is not persistent across sessions.
