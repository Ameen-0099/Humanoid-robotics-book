# Chapter 6 Specification: Movement: Humanoid Kinematics and Locomotion

- **Chapter Title**: Movement: Humanoid Kinematics and Locomotion
- **Purpose**: To explain the fundamental principles of kinematics and locomotion as applied to humanoid robots.
- **Learning Outcomes**:
  - Understand forward and inverse kinematics for robotic manipulators.
  - Learn common locomotion strategies for bipedal robots.
  - Identify challenges in stable humanoid locomotion.
