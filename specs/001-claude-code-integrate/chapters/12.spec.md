# Chapter 12 Specification: Capstone Project: Building an Autonomous Humanoid

- **Chapter Title**: Capstone Project: Building an Autonomous Humanoid
- **Purpose**: To provide a comprehensive, hands-on capstone project that integrates all the knowledge and skills acquired throughout the book to build a functional autonomous humanoid robot system.
- **Learning Outcomes**:
  - Apply knowledge of kinematics, locomotion, perception, and AI for a unified robot system.
  - Develop and integrate software modules for an autonomous task.
  - Troubleshoot and debug a complex robotic system.
  - Demonstrate an autonomous humanoid robot performing a defined task.
- **Required Diagrams**:
  - A high-level system architecture diagram for the autonomous humanoid robot.
  - A flowchart of the capstone project workflow.
- **Code Examples Needed**:
  - Integrated code snippets demonstrating modular components (e.g., perception, control, task planning) interacting.
  - Project setup files (e.g., `package.xml` for ROS 2, `Dockerfile` for deployment).
- **Cross-links to other chapters**:
  - All previous chapters, especially Chapter 1 (Foundations), Chapter 2 (ROS 2), Chapter 6 (Kinematics), Chapter 8 (AI & Planning).
- **Difficulty level**: Expert
- **Tags**: capstone, autonomous-robotics, project, integration, humanoid
