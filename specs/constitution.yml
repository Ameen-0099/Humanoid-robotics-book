style-guide:
  tone: "Clear, concise, and technically accurate, while remaining accessible and encouraging for beginners. Avoid overly academic language."
  diagrams: "All complex concepts, architectures, and data flows must be accompanied by a clear diagram (e.g., using Mermaid.js or generated images)."
  code-formatting: "All Python code must adhere to PEP 8. C++ code must follow the Google Style Guide. All code examples must be complete and runnable."
  writing-constraints:
    - "Explain all acronyms on first use."
    - "Each chapter must be self-contained enough to be understood, but should cross-reference other chapters."
    - "Use active voice where possible."
constraints:
  - "Must adhere to all official Hackathon I rules and submission deadlines."
  - "The project must follow the standard Docusaurus folder structure (`docs/`, `src/`, `static/`)."
  - "All content must be generatable and updatable through automation scripts using Claude Code and Spec-Kit Plus."
  - "Generated content must be compatible with Markdown and MDX."
deliverables:
  - "All book chapter content as a set of Markdown/MDX files."
  - "A functional Docusaurus website rendering the book."
  - "Automated deployment of the Docusaurus site to GitHub Pages."
  - "A specification for an integrated RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) chatbot for user queries (implementation is a bonus)."
