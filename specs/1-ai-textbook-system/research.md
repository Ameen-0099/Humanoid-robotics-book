# Research Findings: Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook System

**Date**: 2025-12-04

## Overview

Based on the detailed feature specification (`specs/1-ai-textbook-system/spec.md`), there are no critical ambiguities or unknown technical areas requiring extensive research at this planning stage. The core technologies and architectural components have been explicitly defined in the constitution and further detailed in the spec.

## Resolved Clarifications

No `[NEEDS CLARIFICATION]` markers were present in the specification after the `/sp.clarify` phase, indicating that all initial ambiguities were resolved or sufficiently defined.

## Best Practices & Patterns (Deferred to Implementation)

Specific best practices for integrating Docusaurus, FastAPI, OpenAI ChatKit SDK, NeonDB, Qdrant, and better-auth.com will be addressed during the implementation phase. These are considered standard development practices within their respective frameworks and do not require pre-implementation research to define the overall architecture.
