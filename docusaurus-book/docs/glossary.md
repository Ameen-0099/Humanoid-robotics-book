# Glossary

This glossary defines key terms used throughout the Humanoid Robotics Textbook.

## Terms

-   **Actuator**: A component of a machine that is responsible for moving and controlling a mechanism or system.
-   **Autonomous Robot**: A robot that can perform tasks without continuous human guidance.
-   **Bipedal Locomotion**: The act of walking or running on two legs.
-   **Center of Mass (CoM)**: The unique point where the weighted relative position of the distributed mass sums to zero.
-   **Conversational AI**: Artificial intelligence systems designed to interact with humans using natural language.
-   **Docusaurus**: A static site generator that helps you build optimized websites quickly.
-   **Embodied Intelligence**: AI that exists in a physical body and interacts with the real world.
-   **End-Effector**: The device or tool attached to the end of a robotic arm, designed to interact with the environment.
-   **Forward Kinematics**: The calculation of the position and orientation of the end-effector from known joint angles.
-   **Gazebo**: A popular open-source 3D robotics simulator.

-   **NVIDIA Isaac SDK**: A platform for developing AI-powered robots, including simulation, perception, and navigation tools.
-   **NVIDIA Jetson**: A series of embedded computing boards from NVIDIA designed for AI at the edge.
-   **Physical AI**: Artificial intelligence that interacts with the physical world through a body.
-   **Reinforcement Learning (RL)**: A machine learning paradigm where an agent learns to make decisions by performing actions in an environment and receiving rewards or penalties.
-   **Robot Operating System (ROS 2)**: A flexible framework for writing robot software, providing tools, libraries, and conventions.
-   **Sensor**: A device that detects and responds to some type of input from the physical environment.
-   **Task Planning**: The process of generating a sequence of actions for a robot to achieve a specific goal.
-   **Unity**: A cross-platform game engine often used for high-fidelity robotics simulation.
-   **Vision-Language-Action (VLA) Models**: AI models that integrate visual input, language understanding, and action generation for robotics.
-   **Zero Moment Point (ZMP)**: A criterion for dynamic stability in bipedal locomotion, indicating the point on the ground where the total moment of all forces is zero.
